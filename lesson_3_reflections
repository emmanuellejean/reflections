When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
    When somebody else is working on your project. 
    When you are on a remote location, and not on your own computer. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	You want to control what your master is, especially when you are not the only one working on your project.
